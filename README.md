# Parking Ticket Management System: Detailed Roadmap

This document outlines a comprehensive roadmap for developing a parking ticket management system, catering to your college project requirements and incorporating a mock UPI-based payment process for India.

*1. System Design and Overview:*

* *Frontend:* 
    * *Technologies:* ReactJS for a user-friendly and interactive interface.
    * *Components:*
        * Login/Signup for registered users and guest parking options.
        * Dashboard for viewing active parking sessions, ticket history, and managing payment methods.
        * Payment gateway integration for processing mock UPI payments.
        * Notification section for displaying alerts and reminders (parking expiration, violation notices).
* *Backend:*
    * *Technologies:* Python with Django framework for robust server-side logic and API development.
    * *API Endpoints:*
        * User authentication and management (register, login, update profile).
        * Parking management (initiate parking session, record vehicle details, calculate duration, generate ticket).
        * Payment processing (mock UPI integration, payment status updates).
        * Ticket history retrieval and display.
        * Notification generation and delivery (email, SMS).
* *Database:*
    * *Technology:* PostgreSQL for a scalable and reliable database solution.
    * *Tables:*
        * Users (stores user information, credentials, and preferences).
        * Parking sessions (tracks active parking details, vehicle info, entry/exit times, duration).
        * Tickets (stores generated ticket data, timestamps, status, payment details).
        * Payment transactions (records mock UPI transactions, amount, timestamp, status).

*2. Development Stages:*

*Stage 1: Frontend Development*

* Design user interface wireframes and mockups for each component.
* Implement the ReactJS application using appropriate UI libraries (e.g., Material-UI).
* Integrate mock payment gateway component for user interaction.
* Integrate notification display functionality.

*Stage 2: Backend Development*

* Set up Django project and configure database connection.
* Develop API endpoints for user management, parking operations, payment processing, and data retrieval.
* Implement mock UPI integration using a library like easypay or similar. This will simulate the UPI payment flow without actual connection to a payment gateway (remember, this is for educational purposes only).
* Develop logic for generating and managing parking tickets.
* Implement notification generation mechanism (e.g., using email libraries or APIs for SMS).

*Stage 3: Database Design and Implementation*

* Create database schema and tables as described in the system design section.
* Implement data models in Django using appropriate field types and relationships.
* Develop database migration scripts to manage schema changes.

*Stage 4: Integration and Testing*

* Connect the frontend and backend by integrating API calls within the React application.
* Implement user authentication and authorization logic.
* Test all functionalities thoroughly, including various scenarios like successful and failed payments, ticket expiration notifications, and user data management.

*5. Deployment and Maintenance*

* Choose a suitable hosting platform like Heroku or AWS for deployment.
* Configure the application and database for deployment environment.
* Implement a version control system (e.g., Git) for code management and future updates.
* Establish a maintenance plan for addressing bugs, adding new features, and updating dependencies.

*Note:* This roadmap provides a high-level overview. Each stage should be further broken down into smaller tasks and milestones during development.

*Additional Considerations:*

* *Security:* Implement robust security measures like user authentication, data encryption, and secure coding practices.
* *Scalability:* Design the system with scalability in mind to accommodate future growth and user base expansion.
* *Documentation:* Maintain clear and concise documentation for the system, including code comments, API references, and user guides.

This roadmap, alongside the mock UPI integration, should provide a solid foundation for developing your parking ticket management system as a college project. Remember to adapt and modify it according to your specific requirements and chosen technologies.


# This is our roadmap for backend
## Detailed Backend Development Roadmap for Parking Ticket Management System

This roadmap outlines the steps involved in developing the backend for your parking ticket management system using Python and Django:

*1. Project Setup and Environment:*

* *Install Python:* Ensure you have the latest version of Python installed on your system. Download and install from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* *Install Django:* Use pip to install Django: pip install django.
* *Create Project:* Start a new Django project: `django-admin startproject parking_ticket_system`.
* *Create App:* Create a Django app for the core functionalities: python manage.py startapp core.
* *Configure Settings:* Update the settings.py file in the main project directory to:
    * Specify database details (e.g., database engine, name, user, password).
    * Configure secret key for security.
    * Add core app to the INSTALLED_APPS list.
* *Run Migrations:* Initialize the database schema: python manage.py makemigrations followed by python manage.py migrate.

*2. User Management:*

* *Models:* Define a User model in core/models.py to store user information (email, password, etc.).
* *Authentication:* Integrate Django's built-in user authentication system using django.contrib.auth.
* *Serializers:* Create serializers in core/serializers.py to convert User objects to JSON and vice versa for API interactions.
* *Views:* Develop views in core/views.py for handling user registration, login, and profile management using relevant forms and authentication functionalities.
* *URLs:* Define URL patterns in parking_ticket_system/urls.py to map API endpoints to corresponding views (e.g., /users/register, /users/login).

*3. Parking Management:*

* *Models:* Define models in core/models.py for:
    * ParkingSession: Stores details like vehicle information, entry/exit times, duration, and associated user.
    * Ticket: Stores generated ticket data, timestamps, status (paid/unpaid), and associated parking session.
* *API Endpoints:* Create views in core/views.py for:
    * Initiating a parking session:
        * User provides vehicle details and desired parking duration.
        * System validates user and vehicle information.
        * Creates a new ParkingSession object and generates a corresponding Ticket object.
        * Returns API response with ticket details.
    * Recording vehicle exit:
        * User provides ticket ID or other identifier.
        * System fetches the ParkingSession and calculates final duration based on entry time.
        * Updates the ParkingSession with exit time and calculates the payable amount based on defined pricing logic.
        * Returns API response with updated ticket information and payable amount.

*4. Mock UPI Payment Processing:*

* *Mock Payment Library:* Install a library like easypay using pip install easypay. Remember, this is for educational purposes and doesn't involve actual payment processing.
* *Payment View:* Develop a view in core/views.py to handle mock UPI payments:
    * User provides UPI details within the API request.
    * Simulate a successful or failed payment using the chosen library's functionalities.
    * Update the Ticket object's status to "paid" upon successful payment.
    * Return API response with payment confirmation or error message.

*5. Notifications:*

* *Notification Model:* Consider defining a Notification model in core/models.py to store notification details (type, message, recipient, etc.).
* *Notification Logic:* Implement logic within views or separate tasks to generate notifications:
    * Upon ticket expiration or violation, create a Notification object with appropriate message.
    * Choose a notification delivery method (e.g., email or SMS APIs) and integrate it within the view or task.

*6. Testing and Deployment:*

* *Write Unit Tests:* Use a testing framework like pytest to write unit tests for your views, models, and serializers.
* *Integrate with Frontend:* Once backend functionalities are developed and tested, integrate API endpoints with your frontend application using appropriate methods (e.g., Axios for React).
* *Deployment:* Choose a suitable hosting platform like Heroku or AWS and follow their deployment instructions.

*Remember:* This roadmap provides a general structure. You may need to adapt and add functionalities based on your specific project requirements and chosen technologies.
